# Taskinator

## Features
1. User can create tasks as well as the type of task it is.
2. Users than can place tasks in either 'In Progress' or 'Completed' column to help organize all their tasks.
3. If user makes a mistake naming or the type of task it is, they can edit it or delete it altogether.
4. Application makes use of localStorage so that the tasks persist if the user refreshes or closes the page.

## User Story
As a user looking for a simple to-do list, I would like an application that allows me to create and organize my tasks so that I can easily see what I have to do, what I have already started, and tasks I have already finished. If I no longer want a task to be presented anywhere, I want to be able to delete them entirely or edit them if need be.
